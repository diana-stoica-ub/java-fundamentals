/**
 *  The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, which share a common,
 *  fixed-size buffer used as a queue.
 *
 * The producer’s job is to generate data, put it into the buffer, and start again.
 * At the same time, the consumer is consuming the data (i.e. removing it from the buffer), one piece at a time.
 *
 * Problems:
 * Make sure that the producer won’t try to add data into the buffer if it’s full
 * Make sure that the consumer won’t try to remove data from an empty buffer.
